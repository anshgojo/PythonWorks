This bot wa inspired hugely by freeCodeCamp.org on youtube.
Although I added some new features and what not I would undoubtedly give the credit to them for that amazing tutorial.
Following is the link to the video tutorial (basic and not the Anime inspired) and their channel:
- Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp
- Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok

Note: I dont suggest you to copy the material (there and mine) but to get reference for making your own. You will have to put you bot token at the end so go 
thruogh the code and edit according to your need.

Thanks for reading!
